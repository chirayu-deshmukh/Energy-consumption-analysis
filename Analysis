Steps Taken:
	1.	Data Collection and Cleaning:
	•	Gathered a dataset of over 500,000 data points on energy consumption.
	•	Cleaned and pre-processed the data using Python (Pandas) to ensure accuracy, handle missing values, and prepare for analysis.
	2.	Time-Series Analysis:
	•	Applied Moving Averages, ARIMA, and ARIMAX models using Python (statsmodels library) to uncover trends and seasonal variations in energy consumption.
	•	Used Excel’s Solver and Data Analysis Toolpak for additional statistical analysis and to fine-tune forecasting models.
	3.	Data Visualization:
	•	Visualized data using Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python for in-depth trend analysis.
	•	Created comprehensive visualizations such as line graphs and area charts in Excel to present insights clearly and effectively.
	4.	Forecasting:
	•	Developed predictive models in Python to forecast future energy consumption, assisting in the creation of energy-saving strategies for the organization.

Outcomes:

	•	Successfully identified key seasonal patterns and consumption trends, enabling the Redwood Coast Energy Authority to implement energy-saving initiatives.
	•	Improved forecast accuracy using time-series models, which allowed better planning and resource allocation for future energy consumption.
	•	Delivered a series of data visualizations and forecasting models that provided actionable insights for the authority’s sustainability and energy optimization goals.

Skills Used:

	•	Python: For data cleaning, analysis, and modeling (libraries: Pandas, statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
	•	Excel: For additional statistical analysis and visualization (using Solver and Data Analysis Toolpak).
	•	Time-Series Analysis: Techniques like ARIMA and ARIMAX for trend identification.
	•	Data Visualization: Created charts and graphs to communicate insights.
	•	Forecasting: Applied predictive modeling to support future energy-saving strategies.
